      <p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Version 5</strong></font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to some financial support 
        from the Verisoft project organised through the Technical University of 
        Munich I have spent several months updating the Poly/ML run-time system. 
        There are many internal changes detailed below but there is one major 
        change that is likely to affect all users. The persistent storage system 
        that has been a feature of Poly/ML almost since the beginning has finally 
        reached its sell-by date and has been removed. In its place there is the 
        facility to export ML functions as object files and link them to produce 
        stand-alone executables.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the ML code has not 
        been significantly changed, with the exception of a new code-generator 
        for the 64-bit AMD/Intel processor, the run-time system has been modified 
        substantially. The aim has been to try to produce a version that will 
        work across a wider range of systems than before and will be much simpler 
        to maintain. The C code has been converted to C++ and standard GNU tools: 
        autoconf, automake and libtool are used to build the system. Memory mapping 
        to fixed addresses, which caused problems with various Linux distributions, 
        has been removed and the use of traps to handle arbitrary precision overflow 
        and heap limits has been replaced by calls into the run-time system. The 
        artificial limits on the size of the heap and of the saved database have 
        been removed and the only limit on the size of the working heap is likely 
        to be swap space.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To build and install Poly/ML 
        download and unpack the source. You can then build poly with the commands</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> <strong>./configure<br>
        make<br>
        make install</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">./configure by default places 
        installed files within /usr/local and in particular the libraries are 
        placed in /usr/local/lib. Some Unix distributions (e.g. Fedora Core) do 
        not include /usr/local/lib in the library search path and on those distributions 
        it may be better to override this by specifying<br>
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>./configure --prefix=/usr</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You build an application by 
        constructing your application as an ML function and calling <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.export</font>. 
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.export</font> takes as 
        its argument a file name for the resulting object file and a function 
        to export. It will automatically add the normal extension for an object 
        file (.o or .obj as appropriate) unless it already included and write 
        out the function and any data reachable from it as a normal operating 
        system object file. This can then be linked with the poly libraries to 
        build an application.</font></p>

        an application</strong></font></p>

        val it = () : unit<br>

        $ <strong>cc -o hello hello.o -lpolymain -lpolyml</strong><br>
        $ <strong>./hello</strong><br>
        Hello World</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have installed the libraries 
        in a directory that is not in the search path you may need to add this. 
        For example<br>
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cc -o hello hello.o -L/usr/local/lib 
        -lpolymain -lpolyml</font><br>
        It is possible to use the ld command rather than cc here but you may need 
        to include some of the default C and C++ libraries on the command line. 
        On some platforms it may be necessary to add -lstdc++ and on Mac OS X 
        you may need to add <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-segprot POLY 
        rwx rwx</font> to prevent a Bus Error when you run your application.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is often the case that applications 
        built using Poly/ML will want to use the normal Poly/ML top-level but 
        with additional ML functions or structures built in. In the old version 
        this was achieved by compiling the new declarations and then committing 
        the database. The new version does this slightly differently. First compile 
        in the new declarations as before and then export the Poly/ML top level 
        by exporting <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.rootFunction</font>.</font></p>

        writes its output to an object file in the native format on the machine 
        on which it is running. Currently Poly/ML supports three different formats: 
        ELF, used on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris; PCOFF, used on Windows and Cygwin 
        and Mach-O, used on Mac OS X. If it is necessary to distribute software 
        in object format it would be inconvenient to have to produce versions 
        for each combination of architecture (e.g. X86-32, X86-64, PPC and Sparc) 
        and each possible object format. To avoid this there is a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.exportPortable</font> 
        function which takes similar arguments to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.export</font> 
        but writes its output to a text file in a portable format. There is a 
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">polyimport</font> command which 
        loads a file stored in this format and runs it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While this is convenient for 
        porting the portable format is not designed for efficiency. The Poly/ML 
        build process uses the portable format within the distribution but the 
        build script then exports the code in the native format. N.B. The portable 
        format only avoids the need to produce different object code formats. 
        It is not portable across different architectures (e.g. i386 to PPC) since 
        the portable file still contains native machine instructions encoded as 
        strings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The previous version of Poly/ML 
        had a command line option to compress a database by sharing immutable 
        data. This has been replaced in the new version by the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PolyML.shareCommonData</font> 
        function. This takes as its argument any data structure and it processes 
        this structure replacing any multiple occurrences of the same immutable 
        data by a pointer to a single occurrence. In effect, wherever in the data 
        structure there are two substructures which would be equal using the ML 
        definition of equality there will be a pointer to a single data structure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The intended use of this is 
        primarily to reduce the size of a data structure before it is exported. 
        It can be used in the above example but in this case the function being

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Printing control switches<br>
        </strong>New switches have been added to the Poly/ML.Compiler structure 
        to control the printing of declarations. In both cases the default setting 
        is true. Setting PolyML.Compiler.printInAlphabeticalOrder causes declarations 
        to be printed in the order in which they were made rather than in alphabetical 
        order. Setting PolyML.Compiler.printTypesWithStructureName to false causes 
        types to be printed without the structure from which they came.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Large database support</strong><br>
        The support for large databases has been improved and it is now possible 
        to create a database which will occupy all of the virtual memory reserved 
        for it. The actual limits vary between operating systems and platforms 
        but are typically around 400Mbytes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">To aid this the -S option when running the disc garbage-collector 
        (-d option), introduced in 4.1.1, has been extended with -Smin and -Smax. 
        The options can be written using either -s or -S and with or without a 
        space. Setting a size is now &quot;sticky&quot; so if no -s/-S option 
        is given the previous limits are retained rather than being reset to the 
        default. The -Smax option sets the limits to the maximum space available. 
        This space now depends only on the size reserved for any parent databases 
        and not, as before, on the history of the database.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The -Smin option compacts the database into a size 
        whose upper limit is set to the size actually in use before compaction. 
        To make best use of it it is probably best to run it twice, once to compact 
        the database and again to set the upper limits to the now reduced size. 
        It is useful when a database has been created which will not be modified 
        further but where child databases may be created. Compacting a database 
        to the minimum size allows any child databases to occupy as much space 
        as possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"> The disc garbage collection has been changed so that 
        it is now possible to use all the address space. Previously it was always 
        necessary to reserve a certain portion of the space to allow the database 
        to be collected.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Flexible records (Pattern rows with record

        </strong>The Standard requires that a flexible record must be constrained 
        to a fixed set of labels by the program context.&nbsp; It does not specify 
        what that context should be. &nbsp; Previous versions of Poly/ML, along 
        with most other compilers, have required the context to be the point at 
        which the declaration containing the flexible record was generalised, 
        often requiring a type constraint.&nbsp; For example:<br>
        <tt>let fun f {a, ...} = a in f{a=1,b=2} end</tt>;<br>
        was rejected.&nbsp; Poly/ML now allows the record to be constrained anywhere

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Linux - Compiling</strong><br>

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Extensions to the Symbolic Debugger.</strong><br>
        The symbolic debugger introduced in version 4.1 has been extended.&nbsp; 
        There are additional functions to step over a function and to step out.&nbsp; 
        The debugger attempts to print the source line when it stops at a breakpoint.&nbsp; 
        For this to work the source must have been compiled using a full path 
        name or the debugger must be run in the same directory that the source 
        was compiled in.&nbsp; The debugger now displays values from opened structures 
        and in abstype declarations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Printing top-level exceptions.</strong><br>
        When an exception is raised at the top-level the compiler now prints the 
        parameters in the exception packet if the exception is declared at the 
        top-level or in any top-level structure.&nbsp; Previously it would only 
        print the parameters if the exception was declared unqualified at the 
        top-level. <br>
        This is particularly useful for exceptions raised by the Standard Basis 
        Library such as IO.Io and OS.SysErr.&nbsp; Previously if, for example, 
        TextIO.openIn failed to open a file the only information available was 
        that the Io exception had been raised.&nbsp; Now the parameters will be 
        printed giving much more useful information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Large databases.<br>
        </strong>Previous versions of Poly/ML had limits on the size of the database 
        of around 63Mbytes.&nbsp; This remains the default limit but larger databases 
        are now possible, up to around 400Mbytes.&nbsp; To increase the limit 
        it is necessary to run the disc garbage collector and specify the -S option.<br>
        e.g. poly -d -S 250 ML_dbase<br>
        This will compact the database and set the maximum size to 250Mbytes.&nbsp; 
        Attempts to set the size to a value which is too large will fail with 
        the message &quot;Not enough address spaces&quot;.&nbsp; The limit on 
        the size depends on the current maximum database size (the larger the 
        current size the smaller the new size may be) and is reduced if the database 
        is a child database.<br>
        There are actually two limits on the size of a database: the mutable data 
        size (space for refs and arrays) and the immutable data size (everything 
        else) and a database cannot be expanded if either of these limits is reached.&nbsp; 
        The space available is divided between these two in the ratio 1:8.&nbsp; 
        There is currently no way of changing this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>CInterface structure</strong><br>
        Added unsigned integer conversions.&nbsp; Added functions to convert between 
        Word8Vector.vector and C arrays.&nbsp; toCchar and fromCchar now convert 
        between the ML char type and C char rather using the ML string type.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Changes to representation of datatypes.<br>
        </strong>There was a potential bug in the way datatypes were implemented.&nbsp; 
        Previously the representation of a datatype was implemented using static 
        information about the number of constructors and their types.&nbsp; Various 
        optimisations are possible if, for example, it is known that the only 
        non-nullary constructor takes a tuple as an argument. &nbsp; These optimisations 
        are not always possible if a datatype can be passed as an argument to 
        a functor.&nbsp; Simon Finn pointed out that datatype replication could 
        result in a datatype being passed into a functor in circumstances that 
        was not possible in ML90. &nbsp; Rather than remove the optimisation the 
        handling of datatypes has been changed so that constructors are passed 
        as arguments to a functor.&nbsp; In practice these are optimised away 
        if functors are expanded inline (the default setting).&nbsp; Because it 
        is now possible to use the optimised representation in all cases the code 
        is likely to be faster than before.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Correctly converts negative hexadecimal numbers<br>
        </strong>Previously values such as ~0x1 were always converted as zero.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Correctly prints singleton records</strong><br>
        Singleton records (e.g. {a=1}) were previously printed as {...}.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Source Level Debugger.<br>
        </strong>This release includes a source level debugger which allows the 
        use to set and clear breakpoints and view local variables.&nbsp; Code 
        compiled for use with the debugger can be freely mixed with other code.&nbsp; 
        See <a href="Debugging.html">here</a> for a full description.&nbsp; A 
        PolyML.Debug structure has been added and a PolyML.Compiler.debug flag.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Free type variables.</strong><br>
        The language definition says that no free type variables may enter the 
        basis but leaves it to the implementer whether to refuse elaboration or 
        instead replace the type variables by monotypes.&nbsp; Version 4.0 refused 
        to elaborate expressions such as<br>
        fun f () = raise Fail &quot;error&quot;; f();<br>
        Version 4.1 allows it to elaborate but produces a warning message.&nbsp; 
        The result is bound to a unique monotype distinct from any other type 
        in the basis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Substantial changes to the optimiser.<br>
        </strong>The optimiser has been substantially changed so that many more 
        cases can be compiled in-line.&nbsp; Small tail-recursive functions, such 
        as List.foldl, are now compiled as while-loops within the calling functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Small recursive functions which are not tail-recursive, such as List.map, 
        are compiled as specialised functions so that the function being mapped 
        is inserted into the specialised function. &nbsp; When mapping a small 
        function over a list this can produce big improvements by avoiding the 
        need for a function call for each element of the list.&nbsp; Applying 
        these optimisations and a few others within the compiler itself has produced 
        a substantial speed up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Formatting of pretty-printed output.</strong><br>
        The format used when printing top-level expressions, particularly structures 
        and functors, has been improved to give a more consistent appearance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Tuples as results</strong>.<br>
        Previous versions of the compiler allocated memory to contain tuples returned 
        from functions or even from an if-expression.&nbsp; This version now allocates 
        store on the stack to receive the results, reducing the load on the garbage 
        collector.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Improvement to TextIO.</strong><br>
        The TextIO structure is defined as imperative operations on top of the 
        functional IO layer.&nbsp; Implementing it in this way, though, turned 
        out to be inefficient if the functional layer was not used.&nbsp; TextIO 
        has now been rewritten so that if TextIO.getInstream is never called on 
        a stream it can be handled entirely within the imperative layer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Specialised equality functions.</strong><br>
        Previous releases contained specialised code for equality for a few built-in 
        types such as int and string but defaulted to the general structure equality 
        in more general cases. &nbsp; The compiler now generates functions for 
        equality in most cases.&nbsp; Because of the changes to the optimiser 
        these will usually be compiled in-line even when operating on recursive 
        types such as lists.&nbsp; This is most successful when the compiler has 
        specific type information so the addition of a cast may well speed up 
        a function. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>X-Windows/Motif - new functions.</strong><br>
        The following functions have been added to the Motif structure:</font><br>

      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Assignment to references in the database.<br>
        </strong>Older versions of the compiler always made calls to the run-time 
        system to handle assignment.&nbsp; In version 4.0 this was changed so 
        that the assignment operation was compile in-line, speeding up imperative 
        functions when the reference being updated was local.&nbsp; If the reference 
        was in the database assignment involved a trap and the assignment was 
        emulated by the run-time system.&nbsp; This has now been changed so that 
        there is only a trap the first time a reference is updated.&nbsp; More 
        specifically, references in the database are packed into pages and if 
        any of the references in a page are updated the whole page is marked &quot;dirty&quot; 
        and no further traps will occur for that page. <br>
        The format of a database has changed slightly as a result so version 4.1 
        databases may only be used with a run-time system built for this version.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Low-level code-generation.</strong><br>
        Various changes have been made to the low-level code-generators, particularly 
        in the handling of constants and calls to functions which are known at 
        compile-time.&nbsp; The code-generators now generate code for more functions 
        such as Word.* which previously required calls to the run-time system.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Functions now contain information about the registers they modify to reduce 
        the need to save registers across calls.</font></p>

        This version has been tested with the release version of Mac OS/X.&nbsp; 
        The foreign function interface (CInterface structure), time profiling

        There was a problem with writing to the database which appeared in some 
        versions of Unix. &nbsp; This was particularly noticeable on machines 
        with slow discs or where the database was accessed over a network.&nbsp;

        might use for its heap. &nbsp; This caused problems if there was a limit

        executable called &quot;discgarb&quot; and invoke the program through 
        that rather than specify the -d option to poly.&nbsp; This previously 
        worked only if the program was invoked as &quot;discgarb&quot; not as, 
        for example, &quot;/usr/bin/discgarb&quot;.&nbsp; This has now been changed

      <h3><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Changes since Beta 4.0</font></strong></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Introduced the POLYPATH environment variable 
        to allow databases to be found using a path.</strong><br>
        When searching for a database, whether given on the command line or to 
        find the parent of a child database, poly searches using the path given 
        in the POLYPATH environment variable. &nbsp; On most platforms it defaults 
        to &quot;.:/usr/lib/poly:./usr/local/lib/poly&quot; meaning that when 
        searching for a database called &quot;dbase&quot; it will first look in 
        the current directory and if that fails look for /usr/lib/poly/dbase and 
        finally /usr/local/lib/poly/dbase before giving up.&nbsp; Setting the 
        POLYPATH to an explicit path allows the user to specify where databases 
        are to be found.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">As a result of this change poly now defaults to searching 
        for a database called ML_dbase in the path if no database is given on 
        the command line. &nbsp; The restriction that a child database can only 
        be created if the parent path name is fully specified has been removed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Removed discgarb and changeParent.</strong><br>
        The discgarb and changeParent programs have been removed and the functionality 
        incorporated into the poly program.&nbsp; New options have been added 
        to poly.&nbsp; The '-d' option compacts a database in the manner of discgarb.&nbsp; 
        An additional option '-c' can be used to run the </font><font size="3" face="Arial">common-expression 
        elimination phase.&nbsp; The '-p' option changes the parent of a database 
        as with changeParent. &nbsp; The old behaviour can be retained by creating 
        links to the poly binary called discgarb and changeParent and invoking 
        the binary through these names.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Changed TextIO.stdOut to use line buffering.</strong><br>
        In Beta 4.0 this was unbuffered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Added interruptConsoleProcesses to the Process 
        structure.</strong><br>
        Process.interruptConsoleProcesses() causes all console process to be sent 
        the SML90.Interrupt exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually there will only be 
        one console process, the top-level loop which runs the compiler and executes 
        the code.</font></p>
