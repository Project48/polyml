<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.1.4 Release</strong></font></h2>
<h3><strong><font face="Arial"><strong>New features and Changes</strong></font></strong></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Converted PolyML.dsw and PolyML.dsp to binary. This simplifies 
  building from source on Windows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The exception PolyML.Commit now has type string-&gt;exn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">PolyML.commit now raises PolyML.Commit if the database is 
  read-only. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Timing functions no longer fail occasionally with getrusage: 
  EINTR on Solaris (actually a work-around for a bug/documentation error in Solaris).</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.1.3 Release</strong></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>New features and Changes</strong></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Printing control switches<br>
  </strong>New switches have been added to the Poly/ML.Compiler structure to control 
  the printing of declarations. In both cases the default setting is true. Setting 
  PolyML.Compiler.printInAlphabeticalOrder causes declarations to be printed in 
  the order in which they were made rather than in alphabetical order. Setting 
  PolyML.Compiler.printTypesWithStructureName to false causes types to be printed 
  without the structure from which they came.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Large database support</strong><br>
  The support for large databases has been improved and it is now possible to 
  create a database which will occupy all of the virtual memory reserved for it. 
  The actual limits vary between operating systems and platforms but are typically 
  around 400Mbytes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To aid this the -S option when running the disc garbage-collector 
  (-d option), introduced in 4.1.1, has been extended with -Smin and -Smax. The 
  options can be written using either -s or -S and with or without a space. Setting 
  a size is now &quot;sticky&quot; so if no -s/-S option is given the previous 
  limits are retained rather than being reset to the default. The -Smax option 
  sets the limits to the maximum space available. This space now depends only 
  on the size reserved for any parent databases and not, as before, on the history 
  of the database.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The -Smin option compacts the database into a size whose 
  upper limit is set to the size actually in use before compaction. To make best 
  use of it it is probably best to run it twice, once to compact the database 
  and again to set the upper limits to the now reduced size. It is useful when 
  a database has been created which will not be modified further but where child 
  databases may be created. Compacting a database to the minimum size allows any 
  child databases to occupy as much space as possible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> The disc garbage collection has been changed so that it 
  is now possible to use all the address space. Previously it was always necessary 
  to reserve a certain portion of the space to allow the database to be collected.<br>
  </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></font></h3>
<p><strong><font face="Arial">Mac OS X 10.2<br>
  </font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mac OS X 10.2 introduced 
  a undocumented change to the kernel interface when delivering signals. This 
  meant that the original binaries will not run on 10.2. This has now been fixed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Crash on delivering console 
  interrupt on PowerPC</strong><br>
  There was a bug in the Poly/ML process (lightweight thread) code on the PowerPC 
  which caused a crash when a process terminated. This could happen when a user-installed 
  signal handler was called, for example the console interrupt handler in Isabelle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Crash in equality code</strong><br>
  An error in the compilation of the equality function meant that certain expressions 
  involving equality could cause a crash. This has been fixed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.1.2 Release</strong></font></h2>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>New features and Changes</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Flexible records (Pattern rows with record wildcards)<br>
</strong>The Standard requires that a flexible record must be constrained to a fixed set
of labels by the program context.&nbsp; It does not specify what that context should be.
&nbsp; Previous versions of Poly/ML, along with most other compilers, have required the
context to be the point at which the declaration containing the flexible record was
generalised, often requiring a type constraint.&nbsp; For example:<br>
<tt>let fun f {a, ...} = a in f{a=1,b=2} end</tt>;<br>
was rejected.&nbsp; Poly/ML now allows the record to be constrained anywhere within the
same topdec. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;moveToVec - invalid constant address&quot;<br>
</strong>The compiler failed with an exception and this message when trying to take apart
a tuple which was known at compile time to be an exception.&nbsp; For example: let val
(x,y) = raise Fail &quot;&quot; in x end; .</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Infinite loop with unterminated input</strong><br>
If an input stream contained an error (e.g. a syntax or type error) and ended without a
newline Poly would go into an infinite loop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Linux/i386 - Crashes with large heaps</strong><br>
There were a number of crashes when the heap grew to several hundred megabytes as a result
of it overwriting other data.&nbsp; The virtual address range used has now been changed.
&nbsp; The maximum size of the heap on this architecture has also been increased to 1.1
Gigabytes for the immutable heap and 256 Megabytes for the mutable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Linux - Compiling</strong><br>
The sources would not compile on some versions of Linux due to the use of
&lt;sys/time.h&gt; instead of &lt;time.h&gt;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Syntax of specifications and signature</strong><br>
There were a number of cases where Poly/ML would not accept the full syntax of Standard ML
97.&nbsp; Empty specifications were not accepted, signature declarations were not accepted
after type declarations within the same topdec and multiple type abbreviations connected
by &quot;and&quot; were not accepted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Windows bitViewer example</strong><br>
The bitViewer example contained a reference to the Base structure which has been removed,
preventing it from compiling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Interrupt exception while running the compiler</strong><br>
Raising an Interrupt exception from the console at certain points within the compiler
could result in confusing traceback information being printed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.1.1Release</strong></font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Update on 5th November 2001(driver source only).&nbsp; Bug
fix: Overflowing Poly stack could cause crash. </strong><br>
A deeply or infinitely recursing function could result in a segmentation fault.&nbsp; It
will now raise an Interrupt exception.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Update on 28th October 2001 (driver source only).&nbsp; Bug
fix: Large heaps in Linux caused random errors. </strong><br>
If the heap grew very large in Linux it could overwrite local variables, causing random
failures.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>New features and Changes</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Windows&#153; interface<br>
</strong>This release includes structures to allow Windows graphical programs to be
written in Poly/ML.&nbsp; See the <a href="Windows.html">Windows Programming in Poly/ML</a>
and&nbsp; <a href="Winref/Reference.html">Windows Interface Reference</a> for more
information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Extensions to the Symbolic Debugger.</strong><br>
The symbolic debugger introduced in version 4.1 has been extended.&nbsp; There are
additional functions to step over a function and to step out.&nbsp; The debugger attempts
to print the source line when it stops at a breakpoint.&nbsp; For this to work the source
must have been compiled using a full path name or the debugger must be run in the same
directory that the source was compiled in.&nbsp; The debugger now displays values from
opened structures and in abstype declarations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Printing top-level exceptions.</strong><br>
When an exception is raised at the top-level the compiler now prints the parameters in the
exception packet if the exception is declared at the top-level or in any top-level
structure.&nbsp; Previously it would only print the parameters if the exception was
declared unqualified at the top-level. <br>
This is particularly useful for exceptions raised by the Standard Basis Library such as
IO.Io and OS.SysErr.&nbsp; Previously if, for example, TextIO.openIn failed to open a file
the only information available was that the Io exception had been raised.&nbsp; Now the
parameters will be printed giving much more useful information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Large databases.<br>
</strong>Previous versions of Poly/ML had limits on the size of the database of around
63Mbytes.&nbsp; This remains the default limit but larger databases are now possible, up
to around 400Mbytes.&nbsp; To increase the limit it is necessary to run the disc garbage
collector and specify the -S option.<br>
e.g. poly -d -S 250 ML_dbase<br>
This will compact the database and set the maximum size to 250Mbytes.&nbsp; Attempts to
set the size to a value which is too large will fail with the message &quot;Not enough
address spaces&quot;.&nbsp; The limit on the size depends on the current maximum database
size (the larger the current size the smaller the new size may be) and is reduced if the
database is a child database.<br>
There are actually two limits on the size of a database: the mutable data size (space for
refs and arrays) and the immutable data size (everything else) and a database cannot be
expanded if either of these limits is reached.&nbsp; The space available is divided
between these two in the ratio 1:8.&nbsp; There is currently no way of changing this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>CInterface structure</strong><br>
Added unsigned integer conversions.&nbsp; Added functions to convert between
Word8Vector.vector and C arrays.&nbsp; toCchar and fromCchar now convert between the ML
char type and C char rather using the ML string type.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Changes to representation of datatypes.<br>
</strong>There was a potential bug in the way datatypes were implemented.&nbsp; Previously
the representation of a datatype was implemented using static information about the number
of constructors and their types.&nbsp; Various optimisations are possible if, for example,
it is known that the only non-nullary constructor takes a tuple as an argument. &nbsp;
These optimisations are not always possible if a datatype can be passed as an argument to
a functor.&nbsp; Simon Finn pointed out that datatype replication could result in a
datatype being passed into a functor in circumstances that was not possible in ML90.
&nbsp; Rather than remove the optimisation the handling of datatypes has been changed so
that constructors are passed as arguments to a functor.&nbsp; In practice these are
optimised away if functors are expanded inline (the default setting).&nbsp; Because it is
now possible to use the optimised representation in all cases the code is likely to be
faster than before.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Correctly converts negative hexadecimal numbers<br>
</strong>Previously values such as ~0x1 were always converted as zero.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Correctly prints singleton records</strong><br>
Singleton records (e.g. {a=1}) were previously printed as {...}.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Some functions with side-effects were not evaluated if their
results were not used</strong><br>
For example, fun f s = (print s; true); fun p s = not (f s); val _ = p &quot;OK\n&quot;;
did not work correctly in 4.1.&nbsp; This has been fixed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Changes to allow compilation on Solaris 6.<br>
</strong>There was a problem compiling the sources in older versions of Solaris.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="4.1"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.1 Experimental</strong></font></h2>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Exception matching in val bindings.<br>
</strong>Previous releases contained a bug in the processing of val bindings when the
pattern was an exception constructor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Closing Standard Output.</strong><br>
Closing standard output caused an infinite loop in previous versions.</font></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Changes since </font><font face="Arial">Version
4.0 Release</font></strong></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Source Level Debugger.<br>
</strong>This release includes a source level debugger which allows the use to set and
clear breakpoints and view local variables.&nbsp; Code compiled for use with the debugger
can be freely mixed with other code.&nbsp; See <a href="Debugging.html">here</a> for a
full description.&nbsp; A PolyML.Debug structure has been added and a
PolyML.Compiler.debug flag.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Free type variables.</strong><br>
The language definition says that no free type variables may enter the basis but leaves it
to the implementer whether to refuse elaboration or instead replace the type variables by
monotypes.&nbsp; Version 4.0 refused to elaborate expressions such as<br>
fun f () = raise Fail &quot;error&quot;; f();<br>
Version 4.1 allows it to elaborate but produces a warning message.&nbsp; The result is
bound to a unique monotype distinct from any other type in the basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Substantial changes to the optimiser.<br>
</strong>The optimiser has been substantially changed so that many more cases can be
compiled in-line.&nbsp; Small tail-recursive functions, such as List.foldl, are now
compiled as while-loops within the calling functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Small recursive
functions which are not tail-recursive, such as List.map, are compiled as specialised
functions so that the function being mapped is inserted into the specialised function.
&nbsp; When mapping a small function over a list this can produce big improvements by
avoiding the need for a function call for each element of the list.&nbsp; Applying these
optimisations and a few others within the compiler itself has produced a substantial speed
up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Formatting of pretty-printed output.</strong><br>
The format used when printing top-level expressions, particularly structures and functors,
has been improved to give a more consistent appearance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Tuples as results</strong>.<br>
Previous versions of the compiler allocated memory to contain tuples returned from
functions or even from an if-expression.&nbsp; This version now allocates store on the
stack to receive the results, reducing the load on the garbage collector.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Improvement to TextIO.</strong><br>
The TextIO structure is defined as imperative operations on top of the functional IO
layer.&nbsp; Implementing it in this way, though, turned out to be inefficient if the
functional layer was not used.&nbsp; TextIO has now been rewritten so that if
TextIO.getInstream is never called on a stream it can be handled entirely within the
imperative layer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Specialised equality functions.</strong><br>
Previous releases contained specialised code for equality for a few built-in types such as
int and string but defaulted to the general structure equality in more general cases.
&nbsp; The compiler now generates functions for equality in most cases.&nbsp; Because of
the changes to the optimiser these will usually be compiled in-line even when operating on
recursive types such as lists.&nbsp; This is most successful when the compiler has
specific type information so the addition of a cast may well speed up a function.
&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>X-Windows/Motif - new functions.</strong><br>
The following functions have been added to the Motif structure:</font><br>
val XtGetApplicationResources: Widget -&gt; (string * string * XmRType) list -&gt; Arg
list <br>
val XtAddEventHandler: &gt; Widget -&gt; XWindows.EventMask list -&gt; bool -&gt; (Widget
* 'a XWindows.XEvent -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit<br>
val XmMenuPosition: Widget -&gt; 'a XWindows.XEvent -&gt; unit</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Assignment to references in the database.<br>
</strong>Older versions of the compiler always made calls to the run-time system to handle
assignment.&nbsp; In version 4.0 this was changed so that the assignment operation was
compile in-line, speeding up imperative functions when the reference being updated was
local.&nbsp; If the reference was in the database assignment involved a trap and the
assignment was emulated by the run-time system.&nbsp; This has now been changed so that
there is only a trap the first time a reference is updated.&nbsp; More specifically,
references in the database are packed into pages and if any of the references in a page
are updated the whole page is marked &quot;dirty&quot; and no further traps will occur for
that page. <br>
The format of a database has changed slightly as a result so version 4.1 databases may
only be used with a run-time system built for this version.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Low-level code-generation.</strong><br>
Various changes have been made to the low-level code-generators, particularly in the
handling of constants and calls to functions which are known at compile-time.&nbsp; The
code-generators now generate code for more functions such as Word.* which previously
required calls to the run-time system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Functions now contain information about
the registers they modify to reduce the need to save registers across calls.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Mac OS/X</strong><br>
Real number rounding control (IEEEReal.getRoundingMode and IEEEReal.setRoundingMode) has
now been added to the Mac OS/X version&nbsp; of Poly/ML 4.1.&nbsp; This version has been
tested with the release version of Mac OS/X.&nbsp; The foreign function interface
(CInterface structure), time profiling (PolyML.profiling 1) and polling (OS.IO.poll) do
not work in Mac OS/X.</font></p>

<p><a name="4.1Update"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>Update on 25th April 2001.&nbsp;
Slow &quot;commit&quot; and database compaction in Linux and Solaris</strong><br>
There was a problem with writing to the database which appeared in some versions of Unix.
&nbsp; This was particularly noticeable on machines with slow discs or where the database
was accessed over a network.&nbsp; A revised version of the driver sources has now been
installed to correct this problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Update on 3rd May 2001.&nbsp; Bug fix: Corrupted parent
database file name. </strong><br>
When running the disc garbage collector on a child database in Mac OS X the parent file
name became corrupted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Update on 3rd May 2001.&nbsp; Fix to allow compilation on
Mac OS X with X-Windows/Motif</strong>.</font></p>

<h2><a name="4.0"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.0 Release</strong></font></h2>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed since Version 4.0 beta1</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>Negative integers printed strangely.</strong><br>
Bug in Version 4.0 beta1: Negative numbers printed as large positive numbers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>Files were created with execute permission.</strong><br>
The default creation mask for files was 777 (read, write and execute permission). &nbsp;
This has been changed to 666 (read and write permission).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>i386 code-generator bug.</strong><br>
A bug was found in the i386 code-generator which among other things caused Poly/ML to
crash when given an integer in hexadecimal (e.g. 0x1).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>Linux:&nbsp; Typing control-C would
sometimes cause a crash.</strong><br>
Poly/ML would sometimes crash if control-C was pressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was highly
timing-dependent and occurred only if the SIGINT arrived at the same time as another
signal such as a SIGSEGV used to indicate a garbage-collection or arbitrary-precision
emulation trap.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Changes since </font><font face="Arial">Version
4.0 beta1</font></strong></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The default for print depth is now 100.<br>
</strong>The default value for PolyML.print_depth is now 100 instead of 1.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Power architecture version now fully supported.</strong> <br>
The Power architecture is now supported under MacOS-X beta and LinuxPPC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Removed various exceptions from the PolyML structure.</strong><br>
The Interrupt, Div, Bind, Match, Size, Overflow, Underflow and Subscript exceptions have
been removed from the PolyML structure.&nbsp; These are either free in the basis or are in
the SML90 structure. </font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial">X-Windows/Motif now compiles with LessTif and OpenMotif.</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Sparc/Solaris: Removed check that the whole of the address
space was available.</strong><br>
The Sparc/Solaris version attempts to reserve a very large region of memory to prevent any
other library from allocating within the area that Poly/ML might use for its heap. &nbsp;
This caused problems if there was a limit on the amount of virtual memory that a program
could reserve and has been removed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Links as &quot;discgarb&quot; and &quot;changeParent&quot;
now work for path names.</strong><br>
For backwards compatibility it is possible to create a link to the poly executable called
&quot;discgarb&quot; and invoke the program through that rather than specify the -d option
to poly.&nbsp; This previously worked only if the program was invoked as
&quot;discgarb&quot; not as, for example, &quot;/usr/bin/discgarb&quot;.&nbsp; This has
now been changed so that only the last component of the name is examined.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="4.0beta1"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>Release notes: Version 4.0 beta1</strong></font></h2>

<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>Bugs fixed since Beta 4.0</strong></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>&quot;InternalError: equality - Overloadset
found raised while compiling</strong>&quot;<br>
This message was produced when compiling certain combinations of overloaded functions and
equality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>Failed to compile properly on RedHat 6.2 and
other recent versions of Linux</strong><br>
The SRPM version of the 4.0 beta release would compile on RedHat 6.2, provided a few
changes were made to the sources but the resulting binary crashed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><strong>StringCvt.padLeft and padRight crashed when
applied to single character strings</strong><br>
These functions caused a page fault when applied to strings containing a single character.</font></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Changes since Beta 4.0</font></strong></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Introduced the POLYPATH environment variable to allow
databases to be found using a path.</strong><br>
When searching for a database, whether given on the command line or to find the parent of
a child database, poly searches using the path given in the POLYPATH environment variable.
&nbsp; On most platforms it defaults to &quot;.:/usr/lib/poly:./usr/local/lib/poly&quot;
meaning that when searching for a database called &quot;dbase&quot; it will first look in
the current directory and if that fails look for /usr/lib/poly/dbase and finally
/usr/local/lib/poly/dbase before giving up.&nbsp; Setting the POLYPATH to an explicit path
allows the user to specify where databases are to be found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As a result of this change poly now defaults to searching for a
database called ML_dbase in the path if no database is given on the command line. &nbsp;
The restriction that a child database can only be created if the parent path name is fully
specified has been removed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Removed discgarb and changeParent.</strong><br>
The discgarb and changeParent programs have been removed and the functionality
incorporated into the poly program.&nbsp; New options have been added to poly.&nbsp; The
'-d' option compacts a database in the manner of discgarb.&nbsp; An additional option '-c'
can be used to run the </font><font size="3" face="Arial">common-expression elimination
phase.&nbsp; The '-p' option changes the parent of a database as with changeParent. &nbsp;
The old behaviour can be retained by creating links to the poly binary called discgarb and
changeParent and invoking the binary through these names.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Changed TextIO.stdOut to use line buffering.</strong><br>
In Beta 4.0 this was unbuffered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Added interruptConsoleProcesses to the Process structure.</strong><br>
Process.interruptConsoleProcesses() causes all console process to be sent the
SML90.Interrupt exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually there will only be one console process, the
top-level loop which runs the compiler and executes the code.</font></p>
