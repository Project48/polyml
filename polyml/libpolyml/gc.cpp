    How the garbage collector works.
    The GC is generational.  There are two modes: minor and full.  Most of the
    code is the same for both.  There are two types of local heap: mutable and
    immutable.  ML and RTS code always allocate new objects in a mutable heap.
    Note allocation is from the top of the area down.
    Originally, there were just two areas but now there may be multiple
    heap segments of each type.  The GC has three phases:

    1.  Mark phase.
    Working from the roots; which are the the permanent mutable segments, the RTS
    roots (e.g. thread stacks) and, if this is a minor collection, mutable objects
    collected in previous collections ("gen_top" to "top"), mark all reachable cells.
    Marking involves setting bits in the bitmap for reachable words.  If this is a
    minor collection we only follow cells that are in the current generation
    ("gen_bottom" to "gen_top").

    2. Compact phase.
    Marked objects are copied to try to compact, upwards, the heap segments.  When
    an object is moved the length word of the object in the old location is set as
    a tombstone that points to its new location.  In particular this means that we
    cannot reuse the space where an object previously was during the compaction phase.
    Immutable objects are moved into immutable segments.  When an object is moved
    to a new location the bits are set in the bitmap as though the object had been
    marked at that location.

    3. Update phase.
    The roots and objects marked during the first two phases are scanned and any
    addresses for moved objects are updated.  The lowest address used in the area
    then becomes the base of the area for future allocations.

    Typically, a minor GC moves immutable data into the immutable area and leaves
    mutable data behind.  The immutable data moved is considered "old" and not
    scanned until a major collection.  However, if a collection finds that there
    are significant holes in the heap (these holes must be in the mutable area)
    it is better to try to recollect the current generation.  In this case the
    immutable data moved during this collection are considered as "new" in the
    next minor collection.  Even though we're only concerned there with compacting
    the mutable area we have to process immutable objects that may contain their
    addresses.

/*
  The comments below may still be relevant.  I've left them in because they
  contain notes about optimisations that were tried in the past and no longer
  apply.

  How the garbage collector works.
  
  Phase 1: Starting from the roots in the old mutable area, and
           any pointers kept by the runtime system, we mark all
           objects that are found within the two GC areas.
           The GC areas extend from the allocation pointer
           to the top of the area.
  
  Phase 2: Then we scan the immutable object bitmap. When we find
           a mutable object we try to find space for it in the mutable
           area, if we find an immutable object we try to find space
           for it further up the immutable area. We may have to extend
           the mutable area to make room for objects since we must not commit
           and leave mutable objects in the immutable area.
           
           Then we do the same for the mutable area, copying immutable objects
           out into the immutable area, and moving mutable objects up.
           
           We keep track of the lowest object that could not be moved.
           The allocation pointers will be reset to the lowest kept objects,
           and the area below is taken to be free.
  
  Phase 3: Then we start from the roots and runtime system objects and
           look for pointers into the GC areas that point to tombstones.
           These pointers are changed to point to the new position of
           the objects. Then we process all the objects in the areas
           doing the same thing.
           
Further notes:

  The order of processing the immutable and mutable area has been changed
  since the above comment was written (by Dave Matthews?).

  It would be nice to combine phases 2 and 3 - we could traverse the
  reachable data-structures, starting at the roots, adjusting pointers
  as we go (rather like copyGC). We would only use the bitmap created
  in phase 1 to tell us where to find space to move the new objects.
  
  The main advantage of this approach is that is likely to be
  quicker - we only have to traverse the new (small?) data-structure
  rather than scanning the (large) mutable buffer.
  
  The disadvantage is that it would leave part of the heap dirty,
  and I think parts of the RTS may depend on any unused heap
  word containing zeroes. I'll have to look at this very closely!
  Note that this is a different issue from the compiler requiring
  the area below the allocation area to be zeroed. (Should we
  fix this?) Here we are talking about the area *above* the
  allocation pointer, which may contain objects, tombstones
  and zero words only.
  
  A second disadvantage is that the "compress" pass may not give
  as good compression as currently, because it wouldn't explicitly
  start at the bottom and work up. In recompense, we would be able
  to recycle all but the length word of a tombstone, so our
  actual space usage might improve.
  
  SPF 21/10/96
  
  I've now deleted all that carefully optimised code that used to zero the
  heap - it's now the responsibility of the compiler (and alloc) to ensure
  that the store is correctly initialised whenever a GC might occur.
  
  SPF 22/10/96
  
  The GC is required to "clean" each area of the heap between pointer and top;
  this area may only contain objects, tombstones and zero words. The GC
  currently does this for the benefit of OpMutableBlock, but this behaviour
  is also required for the PrintLocalProfileCounts in run_time.c to avoid
  core dumps.
  
  SPF 23/10/96
  
  Let's try to improve the design of the garbage collector, by doing partial GCs
  in 5 phases:
  
     (1) Mark
     (2) CopyImmutables
     (3) FixupImmutable
     (4) CopyMutables
     (5) FixupMutables

   What are the advantages/disadvantages of the new approach?
      
       Advantage:
      
           We can copy mutables into the holes left by copying-out immutables,
           which gives better compaction of the mutable area. The inability
           to do this is currently a problem for some applications because
           it triggers far too many full GCs.
        
       Disadvantage:
      
           We have to run the copy and fix-up phases twice. This may be expensive.
        
   Can we get the advantage without the disadvantage by only splitting the Copy
   and Fixup phases when this looks like a win?
   
   Note: we have to separate the Mark and Copy phases, as otherwise we won't be
   able to handle weak pointers. Shame!
