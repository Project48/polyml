/*
This is the first, mark, phase of the garbage collector.  It detects all
reachable cells in the area being collected.  At the end of the phase the
bit-maps associated with the areas will have ones for words belonging to cells
that must be retained and zeros for words that can be reused.

This is now multi-threaded.  The mark phase involves setting a bit in the header
of each live cell and then a pass over the memory building the bitmaps and clearing
this bit.  It is unfortunate that we cannot use the GC-bit that is used in
forwarding pointers but we may well have forwarded pointers left over from a
partially completed minor GC.  Using a bit in the header avoids the need for
locking since at worst it may involve two threads duplicating some marking.

The code ensures that each reachable cell is marked at least once but with
multiple threads a cell may be marked by more than once cell if the
memory is not fully up to date.  Each thread has a stack on which it
remembers cells that have been marked but not fully scanned.  If a
thread runs out of cells of its own to scan it can pick a pointer off
the stack of another thread and scan that.  The original thread will
still scan it some time later but it should find that the addresses
in it have all been marked and it can simply pop this off.  This is
all done without locking.  Stacks are only modified by the owning
thread and when they pop anything they write zero in its place.
Other threads only need to search for a zero to find if they are
at the top and if they get a pointer that has already been scanned
then this is safe.  The only assumption made about the memory is
that all the bits of a word are updated together so that a thread
will always read a value that is a valid pointer.

Many of the ideas are drawn from Flood, Detlefs, Shavit and Zhang 2001
"Parallel Garbage Collection for Shared Memory Multiprocessors".
