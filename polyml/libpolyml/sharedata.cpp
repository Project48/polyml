/*
This code was largely written by Simon Finn as a database improver for the the
memory-mapped persistent store version.  The aim is that where two immutable
objects (cells) contain the same data (i.e. where ML equality would say they
were equal) they should be merged so that only a single object is retained.

The basic algorithm works like this:
1. From the root, recursively process all objects and calculate a "depth"
   for each object.  Mutable data, stacks and code segments have depth 0 and
   cannot be merged.  Byte segments (e.g. strings and long-format arbitrary
   precision values) have depth 1.  Other cells have depths of 1 or greater,
   the depth being the maximum recursion depth until a byte segment or an
   object with depth 0 is reached.  Cycles of immutable data don't arise
   normally in ML but could be produced as a result of locking mutable objects.
   To avoid infinite recursion cycles are broken by setting the depth of an
   object to zero before processing it.  The depth of each object is stored
   in the length word of the object.  This ensures each object is processed
   once only.
2. Vectors are created containing objects of the same depth, from 1 to the
   maximum depth found.
3. We begin a loop starting at depth 1.
4. The objects are sorted by their contents so bringing together objects
   with the same contents.  The contents are considered simply as
   uninterpreted bits.  
5. The sorted vector is processed to find those objects that are actually
   bitwise equal.  One object is selected to be retained and its length
   word is restored to be a normal length (phase 1 had set it to be a depth).
   The other objects have their length words turned into tombstones pointing
   at the retained object.
6. Objects at the next depth are first processed to find pointers to objects
   that moved in the previous step (or that step with a lower depth).  The
   addresses are updated to point to the retained object.  The effect of this
   step is to ensure that now two objects that are equal in ML terms have
   identical contents.
   e.g. If we have
      val a = ("abc", "def") and b = ("abc", "def")
   then we will have merged the two occurrences of "abc" and "def" in the
   previous pass of level 1 objects.  This step ensures that the two cells
   containing the pairs both hold pointers to the same objects and so are
   bitwise equal.
7. Repeat with 4, 5 and 6 until all the levels have been processed.

Each object is processed once and at the end most of the objects have been
updated with the shared addresses.  We have to scan all the mutable and
code objects to update the addresses but also have to scan the immutables
because of the possibility of missing an update as a result of breaking a
loop (see SPF's comment below).

       At this stage, we have fixed up most but not all of the forwarding

               X -> Y <-> Z
           
       i.e. Y and Z form a loop, and X is isomorphic to Z. When we assigned
       the depths, we have to arbitrarily break the loop between Y and Z.
       Suppose Y is assigned to level 1, and Z is assigned to level 2.
       When we process level 1 and fixup Y, there's nothing to do, since
       Z is still an ordinary object. However when we process level 2, 
       we find that X and Z are isomorphic so we arbitrarily choose one
       of them and turn it into a "tombstone" pointing at the other. If
       we change Z into the tombstone, then Y now contains a pointer
       that needs fixing up. That's why we need the second fixup pass.
   
       Note also that if we had broken the loop the other way, we would have
       assigned Z to level 1, Y to level 2 and X to level 3, so we would
       have missed the chance to share Z and X. Perhaps that's why running
       the program repeatedly sometimes finds extra things to share?
