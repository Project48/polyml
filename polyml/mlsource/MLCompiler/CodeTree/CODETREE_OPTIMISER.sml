                   The front end generates functions with more than one argument
                   (either curried or tupled) as pairs of mutually recursive
                   functions.  The main function body takes its arguments on
                   the stack (or in registers) and the auxiliary inline function,
                   possibly nested, takes the tupled or curried arguments and
                   calls it.  If the main function is recursive it will first
                   call the inline function which is why the pair are mutually
                   recursive.
                   As far as possible we want to use the main function since that
                   uses the least memory.  Specifically, if the function recurses
                   we want the recursive call to pass all the arguments if it
                   can.  We force the inline functions to be macros while
                   processing the non-inline functions and then process the

                       compile the functions now if we can and get a constant for
                       the code address.  We can do that for functions which make
                       no non-local references or whose non-local references are
                       by means of constants.  For non-recursive declarations this
                       is easy since an earlier declaration cannot depend on a later
                       one but for mutually recursive declarations we don't know
                       the dependencies.
                       The simple case is where we have a function which does not
                       depend on anything and so can be code-generated in the Lambda
                       case.  Code-generating that may allow others to be code-generated.
                       Another case is where the functions depend on each other but not
                       on anything else.  We can compile them together but not
                       individually.  There are various versions of this second case.
                       The only one we consider here is if all the (non-constant)
                       functions are of that form in which case we process the

               to make sure that any arguments we change in the course of the
               loop are taken out.  For example:
               fun count'(n, []) = n | count' (n, _::t) = count'(n+1, t);
               fun count l = count'(0, l).
               In this case we would start by expanding count' using 0 for n
               throughout, since it's a constant.  When we find the recursive
               call in which n becomes n+1 we find we have to take n out of the
               loop and treat it as a variable.
               We don't need to do this if the argument is passed through unchanged
               e.g. fun foldl f b [] = b  | foldl f b (x::y) = foldl f (f(x, b)) y;
               where the same value for f is used everywhere and by treating it
               specially we can expand its call. 
               This two-pass (it will normally be two-pass but could be more) approach
               allows us to optimise cases where we have a recursive function which
               happens to be non-recursive with particular constant values of the
               arguments.
               e.g. if x = nil ... generates a general recursive function for
               equality on lists but because of the nil argument this optimises
               down to a simple test. *)
            (*
               I'm now extending this to the general recursive case not just tail
               recursion.  If we discover a recursive call while processing the
               function we turn this expansion into a function call and give up
               trying to inline it.  Instead we create a special-purpose function
               for this call but with only the arguments that change as a
               result of the recursive calls actually passed as arguments.  Other
               arguments can be inserted inline in function.
               e.g. fun map f [] = [] | map f (a::b) = f a :: map f b
               where when we map a function over a list we compile a specialised
               mapping function with the actual value of f inserted in it.
