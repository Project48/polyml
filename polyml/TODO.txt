A list of things to do: 

* exceptions thrown in the "--ideprotocol" mode, should result in an
  error response.

* Make sure that side effects in the "--ideprotocol" do not destroy
  error messages. Proposal: send all output to stdout before reporting
  the compilation state. 

* Add to docs that threads run during compilation are the coder's
  responsibility; we suggest that to ensure correct behaviour of the
  IDE, all threads should be complete by the end of the execution of a
  file.
