A list of things to do: 

* Add to ideprotocol: get types/values/sub-structures in a structure.


When there is an error matching a structure to a signature set the error location
to be the location of the declaration of the item in the structure rather than
the location of the signature.

When a value in a structure does not match a signature the type message doesn't seem to
take account of the printer environment.

When creating a default pretty printer involving a constructor that is infixed use an infix layout.

Create separate text and data segments when exporting an object file.

Change exception debug trap.

Pass compile-time type information in the run-time type values when compiling under the debugger.

Add location information to the debugger so that when printing the source location it is able to
provide that to the IDE.

Add structures to the debug environment.

Add PrettyLineBreak to pretty datatype.
