A list of things to do: 

* the .deps file should list full path names. currently changing
  directory before a use will make it incorrect. 
  This is now an IDE issue.

* Add to docs that threads run during compilation are the coder's
  responsibility; we suggest that to ensure correct behaviour of the
  IDE, all threads should be complete by the end of the execution of a
  file.

* Add to ideprotocol: get types/values/sub-structures in a structure.

* IDE protocol
  Change R packet to include ML code rather than load file.
  Add asynchronous code to protocol.
  Remove preUse and put in a separate file.

* Type ID changes:
  Add "description" to type IDs.
