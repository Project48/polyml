A list of things to do: 

* Exceptions thrown during compilation in the "--ideprotocol" mode,
  should result in an error response. The error response should
  include information about the file the error was raised in, and if
  easy the location.

* Make sure that side effects in the "--ideprotocol" do not destroy
  error messages. Proposal: send all output to stdout before reporting
  the compilation state. 

* Add to docs that threads run during compilation are the coder's
  responsibility; we suggest that to ensure correct behaviour of the
  IDE, all threads should be complete by the end of the execution of a
  file.

* Clean up protocol for IDE interaction: add explicit list element
  "L", avoid combined content and sub-elements (e.g. 
  compile result from poly, is currently: 

  ESC 'R' result ESC ',' finaloffset errors ESC-r

  Change to: 

  ESC 'R' result ESC ',' finaloffset ESC ',' ESC 'L' errors ESC 'l'  ESC-r
