(* This is a complete rewrite of the original pretty printer.  The original
   version was written in the Poly language in the early 80s and was based
   on the paper by D.C Oppen in ACM ToPLAS Vol. 2 No. 4 Oct 1980.

   His version was imperative and provided "blockBegin", "blockEnd",
   "break" and "string" functions to lay out the text.  This version uses
   the "pretty" datatype that uses the same model of the text but
   implements it completely differently.

   PrettyString s -
        Prints out the string s
   PrettyBreak(blanks, offset) -
        Provides a place where the text may be broken.  If no break is needed it
        prints "blanks" spaces.  If a break is needed it add a temporary indent of
        "offset" to the indentation of the next block of text.
   PrettyBlock(indent, consistent, context, entries) -
        Defines a block of text.  If all the entries will fit on the line they
        are simply printed out.  If they do not fit the block must be broken.
        If "consistent" is true then every "PrettyBreak" within "entries" (at
        this level only, not recursively) is a break point and the line will be
        broken at that point.  If "consistent" is false then a line break is
        inserted at a PrettyBreak only if the following entry will not fit.
        "indent" is the value that is added to the effective indentation
        each time the line is broken within this block.  It does not affect
        the indentation of the first string in the block. *)
